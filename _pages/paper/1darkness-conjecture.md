Rapture, the natural human condition, turns to suffering in a catastrophically injured psyche, which, as an organic system, will heal itself with vital energy accumulated in the profound rest available in an absolutely dark environment.

I will briefly explain the title, subtitle, and thesis of this part of the book in terms of theory. This site's [primary content](/) is the practical part. Further notes introduce the rest of the essays.

#### terminology

**darkness:** physical darkness  
**conjecture:** a conclusion or supposition based on incomplete information  
**strife:** conflicted effort  
**rapture:** quiet, joyful communion with Universe; normally characterizes all human experience  
**suffering:** spiritual, mental, emotional, physical, social, and ecological distress; human suffering and its attendant problems  
**catastrophically injured psyche:** a consciousness deeply traumatized by the routine brutality of civilization: medical birth, attachment failure, social isolation, neglect and abuse, TV and computers, factory food, day care, school, and job/war/hospital/prison  
**psyche…will heal itself:** consciousness will fully recover, not just cope.  
**profound rest:** hard to believe till you've experienced it!

#### argument

The conjecture is essentially a logical argument, each point of which everyone knows or can discover for herself:

1. Rapture is the natural human condition.
2. The human condition seems to turn to suffering due to catastrophic injury to the psyche.
3. The psyche is a system of an organism.
4. Organisms are self-healing.
5. Healing requires vital energy.
6. Vital energy accumulates during rest.
7. Ideal psychic rest occurs in absolute darkness.
8. Therefore, dark retreating is a way to restore rapture.


#### the darkness conjecture, original

The conjecture's wording used to be different. The original wording influences most of the essays that follow, so I am including it here:

1. Civilized people suffer inordinately from meaninglessness, confusion, self-hatred, disease, sociopathy, and ecocide.
2. These conditions result from _impaired consciousness_, one traumatized into a round-the-clock fixation on gross reality and a denial of subtle reality (dreamtime).
3. This pathological fixation is a defensive posture against further gross injuries which civilization routinely inflicts on its members.
4. Consciousness, as a biological faculty, will heal from these injuries given the proper conditions, primarily _rest_.
5. Sustained total darkness leads to radically altered brain chemistry, inducing deep rest long enough to enable consciousness to permanently heal.
6. Healed consciousness clears the way back to a full life, dispelling our [suffering](/blog/2009/09/conjectures-sixth-point/) and [absurd problems](/blog/2009/09/darkness-made-simple/).

I increasingly found this version convoluted. When I finally read _The Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene_ by Herbert Shelton, I grasped the crucial role in health of vital energy. It integrated the points of the conjecture and is central to its present formulation.

#### further notes

The _application_ of the darkness conjecture lies in doing darkness retreats of increasing length, alternated with periods of radical change in lifeway until vitality is completely restored. Retreating alone will not solve all our problems. As we say in Natural Hygiene, "Health comes from healthful living." 

I believe the darkness conjecture is true because, in my dark retreats and those of 20 clients, I have repeatedly witnessed: relief from existential suffering; healing of psychic dysfunction; habit-changing insights; long- lasting periods of well-being; and occasional rapture.

Dark retreating satisfies my ultra-snobbish _design constraints_ for any such process: that it be simple, quick, cheap, pleasant, reasonable, scalable, and radical. The truth is free (as in speech and beer). Plain and direct like nature, it makes sense immediately. All else is humbug. It gives results in geometrical proportion to efforts. It is fun, easy, and adaptable. It enables people to get to the very bottom of things individually and collectively.

Regarding lifeway change: if the insanity and unworkability of our way of life are not yet obvious to you, dark retreating will change that. Consider yourself warned. In the meantime, note that when I talk about denial, I do not mean it moralistically, as if you're doing something wrong. Denial is simply a result of trauma, a symptom of psychosis. As you heal, you will become able to face the horror of our situation.

Similarly, you may feel that I exaggerate the potential of the self-healing psyche in darkness. I believe I describe it accurately and invite you to find out for yourself by dark retreating the way I recommend.

If our lifeway's insanity is obvious to you, yet you find yourself strangely unable to break free of it, take heart. The chains that bind you are wholly internal, and you will gradually discover them in darkness. The restoration of psychic integrity is the master key to a new way of life. We will still have to open the door and walk through, but we can stop trying to pick the lock.

On Christmas morning, 2008, I solved the mystery I had investigated for over 20 years: Why did a state of rapture arise in me when I was 15 for three months solid, only to fade away?

At 15, I felt depressed, alienated, and hypercritical of everything around me. The year before, my dog and two grandparents had died, my parents had split up and were each unstable, and my all-important older brother had left for college. I did have a good friend and a world-class musical mentor. I struggled to keep my head above water in the soul-devouring world of American high school.

One day I was watching a video of a third-rate spiritual teacher. My dad played it everyday to escape his pain. When the teacher said something banal about just needing to love oneself and be happy, what happened to my negativity was like when Luke Skywalker's photon torpedo hit the core of the Death Star.

Within a few minutes, I had gotten up from my chair and gone outside into gusting spring wind. The clouds swirled and the trees towered over the neighborhood. Scraps of warmth swept past me. Suddenly I could _see_ the beauty of the world. I rushed upwind in the street, gulping it all in, transported.

Everything else paled before rapture. It was a quiet, intoxicating communion with the universe. It was not ecstasy, not a peak experience, but one of _surfacing_. Not drowning anymore, I could breath and see again. Restored to my place in the air, I felt oriented. Rapture felt natural and ordinary; the disruption that preceded it, aberrant. It was, finally, an experience of the normal.

I felt sublime. I thought, _this_ is how life is. Lying on the grass between classes, I would run my hand lightly over the blades in awe; watch them wave exquisitely in the wind; feel cool, delicious air fall down my throat in slow motion; and say it over and over: life is sublime.

Rapture persisted no matter what was happening around me or what I did. It was clearly how life is supposed to be all the time.

So it made no sense when it began to fade. I tried to hold onto it, but it had not come of my efforts, so it would not stay due to them, either. All that was left to me was to find out what had happened. It took 21 years to understand it.

In a word, I had gone into _remission_. The intense biological activity of adolescence had partially restored the integrity of my consciousness. It was impaired by the trauma of our brutal way of life. For the first time since age five, I became especially aware of the perfection, beauty, and harmony of the universe. This naturally induced rapture in me.

However, once I had a biological foothold in adulthood, I _relapsed_. Vital energy levels decreased; my unstable consciousness refractured; my fearful and defensive habits of personality reasserted themselves; and my elevated perspective faded, taking rapture with it.

The experience flattened everything else I was involved in. I had a future in music. I couldn't care less. I wanted to be enraptured again. I made a resolution: "There is a way; I will find it." I started looking closely at other people. I was not the only one with whom this had happened. I became very interested in philosophy.

Until now, I could never explain what had happened to alter my course so drastically. So most of my family remain bewildered about me and all I gave up on. It saddens me. But I needed an answer, and few had more than a piece of it. Like the popular psychologist who named my feeling, [Leo Buscaglia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4WSWcYSOIM).

When the explanation of remission arrived, I had already retreated in darkness. And I had been trained from birth in the design perspective. This means seeking universal solutions to particular problems based on close observation of ordinary constraints. So my solution came full blown with these corollaries:

1. If a slight increase in vital energy from adolescence had caused a temporary, partial restoration of my psychic integrity, a massive increase from resting in darkness could cause a permanent and complete restoration.
2. The influence of someone with psychic integrity is so great that, even narrowly applied, this would rapidly bring an end to human suffering and resurrect the casualties of our mass psychosis: meaning, wisdom, love, health, conviviality, and ecological harmony. 

In that instant, I knew my search was over. One burning question pursued obsessively had finally yielded something worth trying. The theoretical phase of my work was finished, and the practical phase had begun.

_Note: this is a early version of [hygiene](/hygiene/) from the book. So some of the text is the same. But there is much more here about Natural Hygiene and other approaches._

Natural Hygiene's principles enable us to understand how a darkroom retreat works, what part we play in it, and how it relates to our health in general. Natural Hygiene also provides an approach to darkness distinct from the spiritual and conventional scientific approaches often associated with it. 

Inherently Hygienic, the restful use of darkness fits neatly into Natural Hygiene's comprehensive framework. In return, darkness provides Hygiene, nearly perfect in its care of the physique, an equally effective way to understand and care for the psyche. Further, it refounds Hygienic pathology on the deeper basis of trauma, with far reaching implications for Hygiene's place in the world.

This is a lot to discuss in one article. Let's get going.

#### darkness

Human beings are diurnal creatures, normally awake in daytime and asleep at night. This cycle is critical to psychic function. Modern life replaces the natural extremes of sun and stars with the relentless grey of artificial light and sunglasses; natural sleeping patterns with graveyard shifts and afterparties. This, along with a hundred other offenses, has pushed severe psychosis to epidemic proportions.

The stress of ordinary functioning now requires hundreds of millions of people to consume psychoactive drugs. Few caught in this vicious circle want medication, and wonder helplessly how things can possibly change. While many factors contribute to psychosis, Hygienic darkroom retreating provides an opening: a simple way to begin reversing them all at once. First it brings harmlessly to a halt, then provides the being a chance to recover from them. Darkness thus exposes the Achilles heel of the system that causes mass psychosis.

Darkness, like light, is a normal condition of life. As tropical creatures, we should enjoy an average of 10 hours of it a day. We must ensure we receive nature's provision of darkness everyday and, in crisis, provide ourselves with an extended period of it. Darkroom retreating is to the soul what fasting is to the body: massive relief from constant processing of input, and time in which to renew itself.

#### hygiene

##### background

Hygiene is from the Greek, _hygieia_, meaning health. Hygieia is also the Greek goddess of health, who cared for the well-being of the body and the soul.

In English, hygiene means a condition or practice conducive to the preservation of health. In common usage, hygiene means vigilant cleanliness and the use of safety equipment in protection against from a hostile world. By contrast, Natural Hygiene full expresses hygiene's meaning in harmony with a benevolent world.

Observing in nature the healthiness of life, Natural Hygiene identifies the conditions of health with all normal conditions of life (water, air, food, sunlight, rest, exercise, companionship, etc). 
It recognizes the organism's omnipotence in both preserving and healing itself when provided these conditions in proportion to necessity.

Natural Hygiene is based on "Life's Great Law:" that there _is_ life, that life _lives_, meaning it is inherently self-generating, self-preserving, and self-healing in every respect, at every scale, from the cells to the organism as a whole. This implies that: only the organism performs vital action, including healing; and the power employed to perform this action resides with the organism, not anything external to it.

Thus, no drug, herb, or food; no practice, treatment, person, or device heals. All attempts to do so further damage the body's ability and drain its energy to heal itself, whatever benefit might appear in the short term. Whether well or ill, one's conscious role is to discover and provide the normal conditions of life in the proper proportion. The autonomic (involuntary) processes of the organism handle the rest.

Herbert Shelton, the great systematizer of Natural Hygiene, described its practice as, "the employment of materials, agents, and influences that have a normal relationship to life, in the preservation and restoration of health according to well-defined laws and demonstrated principles of nature." 

A drug, for example, is toxic by definition. An organism does not relate with toxins but expels them. Fasting, by contrast, is an instinctual extension when ill of the time between meals. It is normal. It allows the body to rest from most metabolic processes and heal: to repair tissues, eliminate deeply stored waste, and replenish itself to the farthest reaches of every cell with nutrients and energy. So fasting is a part of Natural Hygiene. It has been the ace up Hygiene's sleeve, enabling routine recovery from every known physical illness. But it is extremely difficult to pursue a fast 

##### reform

It feels strange and sad to say that Natural Hygiene is America's most influential school of health and healing, going back 180 years, because hardly anyone knows about it. 1980s bestseller _Fit For Life_ by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond was the last major sign of its existence.

However, everyone has heard of the benefits of exercise, getting enough sleep, fasting, washing after using the toilet, and the dangers of impure food, stale air, and unnecessary medicine. Other nature-based traditions knew of these things, but none of them communicated them to the modern world until Natural Hygiene. Health reformers like Florence Nightingale, founder of nursing, and Sylvester Graham, the namesake of Graham flour, set the world on fire with their logic and simple, pleasant, effective recommendations.

So why did it fade?

One trouble is that Natural Hygiene is so effective it embarrasses medicine. So Hygienic practitioners quickly find themselves on the American Medical Association's legal hitlist. With few exceptions, they either get jailed, ruined, quit, or leave America. This has been the case for over 100 years. I know of two cases first-hand and stories of others are available publicly.

Before targeting non-medical physicians of all kinds, the AMA first gained legal privilege for doctors and propagandized the public. In a lull of Hygienic activity caused by the Civil War; the economic crash a decade later; and the death of its foremost exponent, Russell Trall; allopathy laid claim to Hygiene's widely-accepted teachings---and the massive improvements to public health that resulted. The rest of the teachings, it smeared.

For an unmatched introduction to the basic ideas of Natural Hygiene, including its history, read _The Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene_ by Herbert Shelton. For a radical critique of medicine as nothing more than modernized exorcism, see his book, _Rubies in the Sand_.

As formidible an opponent as the AMA is, one's greatest foe is always oneself. So I have two innovations for Natural Hygiene and one prediction. I am not proposing or suggesting them, because there is no central authority in Natural Hygiene, only nature and reason. So I am just making them, expecting that over time, actively-minded Hygienists will see their logic and value. 

##### natural psychology

Shelton wrote, "The conscious functions of the body serve primarily to protect and provide the needs of the subconscious functions. If we listen to the demands of the subconscious for food, water, air, rest, sleep, activity, warmth, etc, and provide these as demanded, we have fulfilled our conscious function."  
_The Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene_, p139

The trouble is that the "conscious functions of the body", ie, the psyche, itself has demands and is vulnerable to injury. Being self-conscious, human consciousness has the capacity to meet these demands and care for injury. Which is the point of psychology. And without one, Natural Hygiene has been crippled as a system of health.

In place of psychology, Natural Hygiene substitutes typical 19th century moralizing. Given its origins, timing, and history, it could not have done otherwise. But it's time to get with the times and stop ignoring modern psychology's staggering contributions to understanding human health. Sick people do not need to be dismissed or told they are lazy, ie, bad. At some point, that's all Hygiene can do with some of us. It's discouraging and embarrassing.
    
Darkroom retreating, as the application of a genuinely Hygienic psychology, represents a major contribution to Natural Hygienic theory and practice. Just as Hygienic fasting supports physical healing, Hygienic darkroom retreating supports psychic healing. People have souls as well as bodies. Hygiene now has a way to help people care for both with elegance and grace.

##### radicalized pathology

Though vastly superior to allopathic pathology, Hygienic pathology has remained limited and repressive. In a complex formulation, it attributes illness to the twin causes of enervation (low vital energy) and toxemia (excess latent toxins). These, it has said, are brought about by poor habits. But Hygiene has not been able explain how the healthy creatures we had to have been at some point ever acquired poor habits. Nor why people persist in them even after agreeing they are unhealthy. Hygiene, dependent on often weak wills, has been reduced to grandiosity and moralizing.

The identification of the self-healing psyche implies that trauma causes enervation and toxemia. Malfunction begins with trauma by definition. Trauma necessitates immediate vital accommodation. Psychic trauma, typically repetitive, finally disables the psyche from recovery and entrains it to persist in these unintentionally acquired habits.
    
With trauma at the base of its pathology, Hygiene is now free to address it. This will gradually eliminate most trauma from human experience because people will no longer be unconsciously compelled to recapitulate it. This frees Hygiene from the strange regard for and dependence upon surgery inherited from its _ex-doctor_-founders (ahem).
    
##### prediction

Surgery being allopathy's only remotely legitimate activity, a trauma-based pathology renders allopathy (Western medicine) useless in principle and eventually in fact. Allopathy has only dominated health care because of its willingness to relate to trauma, however fiendishly, and its mythical power to treat. As the recurring cause of all our woes, trauma is necessarily the fixation of everyone in this lifeway. It makes the frightened allegiance to allopathy seem like wisdom. As Natural Hygiene demonstrates the baselessness of this fearful motive, public health will improve even more than it did in the 1800s. Then Natural Hygiene will be permanently elevated to pre-eminence in health care.

After awhile, Hygiene itself will be forgotten because people will simply know how to live. Hygiene will be so integral to the new lifeway, there will be nothing to distinguish it from.

As Lao Tzu said, "The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao." So much for the curse of human suffering. 

#### management

Though I had been exposed to its basic ideas, hygiene was only vaguely in my mind when the self-healing psyche dawned on me. It took a couple months to solidify the connection between the two. An exchange with a friend, Brian, brought it out. 

In our exchange, he talked about Family Constellations. This is an intense weekend training in self-discovery whose methods he said might be useful to darkroom retreating. He wrote me in response to my idea of the civilized "management" of human suffering in [strifeless](../strifeless/). (Some of this may not be clear, but I think Brian's general idea comes across): 

> About "management" and weekend workshops, I cannot help but think of Family Constellations. I think Constellations, when done by less-skilled facilitators might fall, to some degree, into the "life is suffering/strife: learn to live with it" category. But the facilitator I like best to work with seems not to suffer from such a blindness to subtle reality (see [dreamtime](../dreamtime/)) as the rest of us, which&mdash;along with some other skills&mdash;allows him to offer that awareness to the rest of us in powerfully serving our healing. Such awareness can lead to strifeless modalities of healing and restoration, I submit.

I replied that, unfortunately, Family Constellations is probably only minimally useful in darkness. Like various other forms of transpersonal psychology, it lies somewhere between management and discipline, two of civilization's three standard approaches to inordinate suffering. The degree of knowledge and skill it requires makes it full of strife.

Myself, I invested a great deal of energy for a decade in tantric Hinduism. It makes me want tantra to be a critical element in this process. That it may very well not be is difficult for me to swallow.

Family Constellations and methods like it have helped many of us in our quest for well-being. But I no longer believe any method will get us over the hump, even with the best of facilitators. I also do not think it is enough to have the presence of someone else with access to dreamtime, even if an energetic transmission from him takes place.

I have received such boosts from wise people before. They feel great. But ultimately, spiritual hunger---longing---is only a symptom of an underlying injury which prevents us from metabolizing already plentiful spiritual food in the first place. Thus, healing of this underlying injury must occur for lasting satisfaction. Healing is not accomplished by the consumption of any kind of food, nor by the will of self or others, but in repose by the quiet, autonomic processes of life.

#### passive support

This is the idea, anyway. And this why it is Hygienic in nature. Darkness is not primarily about hyper-secretion in the brain of DMT, remembering of dreamtime, accessing higher states, or practicing meditation techniques, all of which can happen in darkness. It is about the profound absence of stimulation and activity which provides for an unusual degree of healing to occur. It is thus a fundamentally different approach from active ones. It is grounded totally in normal organic processes, such as those of the involuntary nervous system, which occur far beneath the level of consciousness, and the self-maintenance of cells, where the nervous system does not reach at all.

The ego's grip is overwhelming. And civilization has taught us well: in various ways, we have all come to think that somehow, someday, we would finally _do_ something about our quandary. The conjecture asserts that we cannot do anything about it directly. We are utterly helpless in our post-traumatic fixation and denial. It is not a pleasant thought. But it is fruitful because it can elicit a strong enough response from conscience to finally support the self-healing organism. Attitude affects recovery.

In the relationship between food and nerve energy lies an example of the Hygienic perspective. Food does not actually give energy to the body directly. Food takes nerve, chemical, and muscular energy to eat and digest. Otherwise we could just eat to restore our strength. Food provides sugar, which refuels everything from large muscle movement to thinking to cell operation. Some of this refueling can occur within seconds of eating easily digested food like fruit. But the body transforms sugar into reserve electrical potential of the nerves only during sleep. It eliminates toxins from tissues and repairs them completely only while they are unused. Again we see that no externality, but life is the only owner of the power to act for itself. Life is the doer.

Pathologically disidentified from life, we are as yet powerless. We who still stumble chaotically try to control life rather than serve it. So we are not going to handle our quandary. As we imagine ourselves to be, we are not going to get it done or have anything to do with its getting done. We are not going to figure it out. We are fit to be tied.

The best we can do is fully admit to our helplessness and to surrender to the only forces that could ever untie the knot. It is the Gordian Knot. But the knot actually needs to be untied. Alexander did not really handle it by cutting it open with his sword, and neither will we with our plans or efforts or skills. Only the small, silent, slow tendrils of the organism's own intelligence can untie such a tangle.

The only effort involved is supportive: to maintain the conditions of healing. This ain't a tall order. Stay in the darkroom. Lie down as much as possible. Eat. Exercise. Bathe. Eliminate. Meditate when so moved. Lie back down. Stare at the backs of your eyelids or follow your breath and let sleep come.

It will anyway. Darkness ensures it. A nervous system flooded with melatonin, the pineal gland's response to darkness, is pretty compelled to sleep. And sleep deeply: you are positively knocked out. You have very few dreams. In 48 hours you will catch up on all the sleep you have ever lost. I am not speaking metaphorically. It is difficult to conceive or believe until it happens.

To me, it felt like falling through a trapdoor. I felt five or six more such trapdoors awaited me before I would see the other side of my personal struggle, my lifelong dilemma. In the meantime, there were times I felt I was crawling in my skin. So the whole thing was alternately very pleasant and very unpleasant. It is certainly unpleasant to discover the concrete form of one's slavery in all its reticulated techno-horror. But it is no worse than what we go through anyway. It is just that it is accelerated and concentrated, and there are no distractions. And there is a chance of never reliving the horror again.

How do you prepare for darkness? It is mostly logistics: making and furnishing the room, scheduling with a supporter, stocking the food. If the room works, the retreat probably will, too. Instructions are given for all this in the rest of these pages. The attitude I try to convey here and in the article, [protocol](/protocol/) is natural and for most people will come over time in darkness. I'm just trying to provide the words for it. 

Otherwise, you prepare the same way you prepare for weeks in a hospital bed in traction. Ie, I am sorry. It is too late. You are already prepared.

#### food

Due to decreased activity, stress, and appetite, darkness presents a miraculous opportunity to:

- eat well
- interrupt the malnourishing, dissociative, toxifying relationship with food from which most of us suffer
- clearly experience one's thoughts, feelings and sensations again

This is why I serve and recommend only fresh fruit and greens to retreatants. As a sampling of the frugivorous diet, common to all anthropoid primates (like us), these foods only nourish. They do not overtax digestion, intoxify or overstimulate the system, nor sedate feeling or memory.

For more about frugivorous diet, I highly recommend _The 80/10/10 Diet_, Douglas Graham's crystalline magnum opus.

That said, if: you are interested in retreating; the prospect of eating just fruits and vegetables stops you from doing so; and you are currently uninterested in learning about it for any reason; then just plan to eat in darkness as simply and naturally as you know how. 

#### spirituality

Many traditions use darkness: Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, Sufism, Ayurveda, Native Americans, Welsh shamanism. South American tribes use ayahuasca with DMT in it. I know little about them. But they do not seem to emphasize the passive rest or healing possible in darkness. They emphasize active _practice_ of some kind. They value lessons learned, virtues developed, levels of spiritual realization attained. It is all so very fascinating. And it is fine. But we have all eternity for practice. As EJ Gold says, there is no top end to spiritual work. But _this_ organism, this chance at life, does not have forever. And its needs are too simple to justify ignoring.

Natural Hygiene's passive emphasis on rest and healing is very important because it defines the appropriate _attitude_ toward the retreat. The mind becomes extremely powerful when it is resting and purifying. I learned in fasting that how one approaches a retreat has a great effect on what happens in it. If ones attitude is really to passively let the healing forces of the organism do everything (in conjunction with the benevolence of the universe), the effect will be much different than if one has the doer-attitude of a practitioner. I know no one who has gone into darkness with the hygienic perspective, with the sole purpose of simply providing the conditions of life to the self-healing organism. Since the organism is the only thing that can heal the organism, this is potentially far more powerful than any other approach can be.

The spiritual approach is to exert supereffort to gain special access to the energy necessary for transformation. My approach has become explicitly and exactly the opposite: rest profoundly to accumulate the energy necessary for restoration. My goal is to find a way to do this&mdash;restore original, organic innocence&mdash;in one shot. Like healing a broken bone. In the meantime, the retreats are alternated with periods of radical lifeway changes they make possible.

When we absorb a minimum of the wisdom of the body, we may become qualified to explore spiritual things on their own terms, not as thinly disguised ego enhancements. Maybe spirituality is a symptom of our illness and it will not be interesting to whole people. For example, observe how it turns natural human capacities into goals to be reached by learning and effort rather than things to be restored by autonomic processes. Maybe, in the restoration of psychic integrity, the arbitrary distinction between autonomic self-healing and the grace of god will collapse.

#### therapy

The other thing that a Hygienic darkroom retreat is not is therapy. Therapy is something that is done to the organism---a treatment---with the idea that the therapy is going to effect some change, that the actors in the situation are the therapist, therapy, and therapeutic substances or practices. The body is viewed as a passive reactor, helpless to varying degrees (depending on the therapeutic philosophy applied.)

This totally defies the Hygienic approach. In hygiene, the will, the very thing that is damaged and needs a break, is passive, and the autonomic system is active. It is true that something must be done. Just not directly by _me_, the conscious part of myself. Only the organism has the power to act directly to repair its damage and correct its malfunction. Rather than taking over, the will becomes the servant of the autonomic, of life itself. Which is actually how it is supposed to be all the time. In darkness, one has a chance for this fundamental orientation to be restored.

Usually, we give attention to the sensational effects of psychic illness: insights, beliefs, thoughts, feelings, muscular tension, physical illness. Those fascinated by these effects actively dig for them, analyze, examine, synthesize them, and make a big deal about working with them and the wisdom necessary to do it properly. But though these things seem to make our lives crazy, they themselves arose from madness. Modifying them cannot lead to sanity. The problem is not negative thoughts, but damaged faculties incapable of producing sufficient positive thoughts.

So in Natural Hygienic psychology, we look beyond all these for help, to insensible processes healing. Insensible because the nerves do not reach down that far. The autonomic self performs the heavy lifting. We wait for this deeper process to produce noticeable artifacts worth the little conscious consideration called for. We passively provide this process of healing what it needs in ordinary ways. We know that once something visible emerges from the process, it is all over but the shouting (literally). Insight leads not to healing. Healing leads to insight.

#### summary

In the hygienic use of darkness, rest, and the other requirements of the automatically self-healing organism are emphasized. This is because no treatment, substance, or practice can substitute for the organic function of self-healing. Exercise and meditation do not heal us. Nor do talking, emotional exploration, or precise movements. They _cannot_, because they engage the very faculties in need of repair. At most, they can merely support the healing process. Anyway, I am still an injured infant, not a healthy, capable adult. "Spiritual" things may happen, but it is unimportant. We are not trying for a vision of god here. We are trying to get out of a big dreary hospital. 

Freedom is only a light switch away.

While chatting online with a friend, Brian Sullivan, I described to him my brief waking experience of dreamtime and wrote a bit about the pineal gland. I had learned about it from Mantak Chia in [_Dark Room Enlightenment_](http://www.scribd.com/doc/7109388/Mantak-Chia-Dark-Room-Enlightenment) and [David Wilcock](http://www.divinecosmos.com/videos/free-videos-online/374-the-2012-enigma-free-full-length-documentary-film) in [_2012 Enigma_](http://youtu.be/o1Hw8DVLw-A). Here is the edited chat:

> **Andrew:** Darkness signals the pineal gland to secrete melatonin. Melatonin causes us to sleep.
>
> The pineal gland reuptakes melatonin and remanufactures it into pinoline, 5-Meo DMT, and finally, DMT. Apparently, DMT is the main chemical going through the brains of yogis when they are in deep states of meditation. Mantak Chia talks about this stuff.
>
> **Brian:** Oh yeah, I guess he does, although I have not read it, but he has his dark retreats.
>
> That reminds me of a story of his checking his stocks on his PDA in the middle of a dark retreat.
>
> **A:** Thats hilarious.
>
> **B:** Yeah.
>
> **A:** Its important to keep your priorities straight in spiritual life.
>
> **B:** Hey, non-duality, man!
>
> **A:** Its all one, man.
>
> **B:** You know it.
>
> **A:** Anyway, the pineal gland itself activates. Apparently it has rods and cones just like our eyes, which are light receptors, but no pupil. It does not deal with external photons. It is the third eye. It sees these other non- physical dimensions.
>
> **B:** Wow.
>
> **A:** One of them&mdash;the one I am after, which I had eight seconds of back in November&mdash;is dreamtime. Dreamtime, which David Wilcock and some scientists call _timespace_, is where three dimensions of time&mdash;past, present, future&mdash; occur simultaneously and space is one-dimensional. This is the exact opposite of spacetime, the familiar gross dimension. Entering timespace enables travel through time the same way that being in spacetime enables travel through space, such as strolling through a field or climbing stairs.
>
> **B:** Awesome.
>
> **A:** Yeah, it is awesome for sure. It felt unbelievably good. Suddenly I could FEEL my housemate through the wall and his grandson in yet another room. Like I can feel this keyboard. In fact, we were all sitting at computers at the time, out of each others sight. And everything was blue, like we were underwater.
>
> **B:** Yessiree good.
>
> **A:** All my worries disappeared. I felt content, fearless, and totally connected with my housemates. Suddenly, nothing else mattered. All my scheming and struggling ceased. But when gravity shifted and everything started tilting backward like a carnival ride, I got a little nervous and came out of it.
>
> It was a long eight seconds. So now I know for sure this other dimension is real. I know for myself. The thing is, dreamtime-awareness is basic to human life, just like our awareness of the gross, physical dimension. Our repression of our awareness of it is what makes everything about us go haywire.
>
> **B:** Hmm, reminds me of a movie with Aborigines, cant remember the title, about dreamtime. It ends with a tsunami.
>
> **A:** Wow, Id love to see that.
>
> **B:** Yeah, we watched it at "Tribal Movie Nights" a year and a half ago.
>
> **A:** Let me know when you remember the title.
>
> **B:** I can look it up.
>
> **A:** Cool.
>
> By all accounts, there are other dimensions that are higher, not necessary to know right off. But dreamtime is critical to know at least by adulthood, when young indigenous men and women get initiated into it. I think this is the dimension _adults_ know. It is why indigenous people generally consider us to be children. Slow children with powerful weaponry.
>
> We substitute many things for dreamtime. Dreams, for one. Real sleep is mostly dreamless. Movies, mass politics, celebrities, computers, tv, video games are all great dreamtime artifacts, or analogues, rather. These are all products of a fear-ridden imagination.
>
> Just as the thinking center is closely allied with the gross dimension, so is the feeling center allied with subtle dreamtime. Let the mind rest and heal from its fixation on the physical; give it a chance to reorient with dreamtime; and the repression, the denial of the feeling center itself will lift.
>
> **B:** _The Last Wave_. Now Ill catch up on reading what youve posted.
>
> **A:** Cool-_Last Wave_.
>
> With the recovery of feeling comes the real possibility for health, since disease is rooted in emotion&mdash;frozen feelings from the past that repeat mechanically in the present.

#### Afterword

These emotions start to clear out when feeling returns. The compulsions, habits, and addictions one has that erode health are rooted in emotion, so they would begin to dissolve, too. One could begin acting on things about which she already knows better. Learning about something good could actually help the learner rather than inform the ego as to what _not_ to do.

In supporting consciousness to dislodge itself from its fixation on the gross physical dimension; and by reversing our denial of our awareness of dreamtime; we could actually let go of the residual effects of our impairment: spiritual emptiness, mental confusion, negative emotion, physical illness, social collapse, and ecological destructiveness. They could all just begin dissipating like a bad dream we are no longer stuck in.

In short, we would no longer depend for our liberation on the rarities of sufficient will, luck, power, or advanced spiritual realization, but on an ordinary state of consciousness immediately available to all.

_This essay is the heart of my work. It describes the insight that instantly precipitated the solution described earlier in [rapture](/darkness-conjecture/rapture/)._

On Christmas morning, 2008, I finally saw that I see the world:

* incompletely
* with tremendous distortion
* and with _no_ power to do anything about this directly.

My consciousness itself has been injured, my psychic integrity disrupted. It is an organic condition, like a bruised muscle or a broken bone. Ordinary use reinjures it.

It is common knowledge that we in this culture are neurotic. What I saw on Christmas is that the situation is far worse than that. We are _psychotic_.

Psychosis is the inability to distinguish reality from fantasy. We really believe that the sliver of reality of which we are aware makes up the _entirety_ of reality. I knew about this pretense before. But only in my head. On Christmas, I felt it. I saw it in myself. It was so huge, so real, like looking over a cliff at a vast and intricate panorama I had walked past everyday without ever noticing.

(Fortunately, our whole way of life is bent toward making the world in the image of the sliver. So within this lifeway, we can be considered functional psychotics. Everywhere else, they can see we are just plain crazy).

Curiously, I felt elation about this. In realizing my own utter helplessness to do anything directly about my "cramp" (an unconscious, habitual contraction from life), I felt an enormous relief. The relief came from not having to try to do anything about it anymore, because it is impossible. It is not a moral issue. It is disease---an organic condition arising from psychic injury. I could quit all the internal tricks I thought were keeping the chaos in check. The pretensions. The disciplines. The slogans. They would never fully work. They could never get under the psychosis or overturn it. Practicing them could only buy me a temporary or partial improvement while reinforcing the underlying impairment.

I had thought the problem was amenable to will, something I could address by effort in spiritual, mental, emotional, physical, social, and ecological terms. But these are merely the ways I experience the problem. The problem itself precedes and causes all of these kinds of suffering. My consciousness itself is _impaired_ due to damage. And this condition, in the words of spiritual teacher, [Arnaud Desjardins](http://www.arnauddesjardinsvideos.com/), is "permanent for the time being." Intractability is its name.

The impairment is a systemic malfunction in my basic awareness. Sitting in this house, I may be aware of the walls, the desk, the music in the background. But my awareness of entire categories of related facts, both subtle and gross, is repressed. Omission, hyperbole, and disproportion characterize my awareness.

Only a force from outside my habitual frame of mind can change this. And seeing this fact is not enough. It will take some kind of real submission to this force that exists outside the bounds of my egoic defensive strategy, a strategy to which I am normally enslaved. I am trapped in a cell with a madman who has total power over me. The madman is relentless. I am helpless. The walls are impregnable. This is the case.

And this, amazingly, can be dealt with. Trying to manage the madman, to deny his presence, to deny the cage itself cannot work. But in acknowledging the perfection of the trap I am in, I am freed, in principle, from struggling against it. This means I no longer have a justification for trying to escape the trap, even if my machine—my habit body—will still try. The _morality_ of trying is dissolved. Attention is somewhat freed to become fascinated by the trap itself.

But I am still in a strange bind. I cannot beat the madman or escape. And I cannot completely stop myself from trying. In civilization, we are enjoined to resolve this bind by surrendering our helplessly relentless wills to the accomplished or embodied wills of others. This explains the worship, for example, of gods, gurus, states, ideas, institutions, and civilization itself. They are forces "greater than oneself" that can overcome ones will and either subdue the madman or offer protection from him… for a price.

If I am to become free without resorting to these agents of civilization (enslavement) I must discover another actor. Something needs to happen. Something must be done. But being helpless myself, I cannot be the actor. At least, I cannot be the star.

I studied my trap for some time. Now, I believe the actor is to be found in the walls of the prison itself: in the body. By this, of course, I mean the entire organism—the being—not just the parts that scientists discuss in public. The actor is the autonomic, self-healing power inherent in all life, the self-preserving, self-restoring power of every cell, every organ, and every system of every organism that ever lived.

I would like to briefly catalog the prison experience so you can be sure of what I am talking about.

Spiritually, psychosis appears as emptiness, meaninglessness, longing, dissatisfaction, disappointment, or an unsavory indifference. I spent a long time in the spiritual world thinking the solution was at hand. The people who occupy it with integrity are extremely impressive and rare. Spiritual life deals with psychosis at a deep level, but still only with its effects, not its cause. So the grace it invokes in peoples lives is partial and fragile. Except for the lucky, it leaves them a little weird or assholish.

Mentally, psychosis is often experienced as confusion and rigidity. Intellectuals like me know this all too well. One is rarely if ever able to decide, to be quite sure of anything. One becomes absent-minded, abstracted, aloof, forgetful. Strangely, this prompts one to cling harder to one's convictions. Every opinion becomes cherished. There is nothing so absurd as some intellectual hasn't made a doctoral thesis of it.

Psychosis is experienced emotionally as anxiety, rage, or overwhelming worry. Sometimes it comes in the form of self-hatred as the result of unstoppable self-condemnation for unstoppable habits. You know, like when you feel so bad about something you did or said or thought for the millionth god-damned time that you just want to die? That is the intensity I am talking about: the kind of shit that drives people to suicide or church or psychiatrists… or public office.

Personally, I suffer from exhaustion-depression, attachment disorder, social anxiety, and symptoms of Asperger's. These have rendered me largely incompetent except for discovering, writing, and speaking about the darkness conjecture.

I'm very slow at everything. I had to become like this to finally notice something that has been holding perfectly still in a total darkness for thousands of years.

Many of us suffer psychosis as physical disease. Knees that just will not come back from that fall. A back that seems pitted against our efforts to live. Cancer or a heart attack that simply kills, quickly or slowly. Or comes back again and again. It starts as a cold and ends as AIDS. If the disease does not get us, the doctors, with their ascientific treatments, knives, and drugs, probably will: iatrogenic (doctor-caused) disease is the 4th leading cause of death in the US now. They openly admit they do not understand most of the diseases they arrogantly offer help with, like the priests of an angry, inexplicable god. Strangely, we pour our life-savings into their pockets. We watch ourselves and each other do it just as we have been told to, as if it is inevitable. It is like one of those dreams in which one can do nothing but play along.

Cultural leaders seek social, political, economic, and ecological solutions to the various modern plagues. But it's Humpty Dumpty. Pens and guns are no more effective than scalpels. The strange persistence of these plagues derives from psychosis epidemic among the sufferers and reformers alike. Their initiatives are as futile as flicking ping pong balls at King Kong.

In the same moment of my discovery and acceptance of my psychosis, it further occurred to me that:

* psychosis is an impairment of a consciousness
* consciousness is a biological phenomenon, a function of an organism
* organisms are self-healing, given proper conditions
* consciousness can thus heal from its psychosis

The problem is organic in nature, in tissues gross _and_ subtle. It is not primarily spiritual, mental, emotional, physical, social, or ecological. These are merely the ways the problem is experienced. Meaninglessness, confusion, etc, are merely symptoms of injury. Addressing them directly is futile. The problem consists of an awareness that is massively damaged, almost annihilated, not one that is merely deluded and in need of policing or education. After the Bomb fell on Nagasaki, nobody there complained of bad trolley service.

When we were young, we were comprehensively traumatized by a broad stream of injuries. Our well-meaning forebears unconsciously tailored these injuries to our personalities, touching every aspect of our beings, and recapitulating the massive injuries of our ancestors going back thousands of years.

Trauma is partly a systemic shut-down of non-critical systems. It is characterized by disruption and contraction of organic function. What remains becomes exaggerated and repetitive, no longer fluid and responsive.

Our trauma trips consciousness on in a way that makes it impossible, under normal conditions, for it to ever go off again. We keep living as if everything is fine. We endure ordinary demands with less-than-ordinary faculties. In this state, characterized in the personality by fear, repression, fixation, and confusion, we veer madly off-course in our daily lives. This leads to enervation and intoxication, the beginning of chronic disease.

Popular culture offers a near infinitude of distractions to numb, salve, bandage, blot out, and delay dealing with the problem until death or insanity come—but not before passing on the legacy of psychosis to the next generation.

Spiritual teachers have viewed the problem of inordinate suffering as requiring discipline and a willed lifestyle change toward saner practices. The intense demands of this approach leave most people out in the cold. We are the losers of the world.

Psychiatry, as a particularly macabre extension of modernism and scientific materialism, attempts to treat consciousness as a gross-dimensional object, the kind which consciousness is already fixated upon and believes itself to be. Anti-psychotic drugs, the apotheosis of materialistic spirituality, are especially in vogue. Equally useless are the various therapies: talk, somatic, art, vocational, etc. To varying degrees, all of these treat consciousness as inert putty with no self-healing power. It is just something stupid and stubborn that must be levered back into function. Internally we use acts of will—ironically called "choices" and effort. Externally, we use and accept treatment, manipulation, and finally, force.

By contrast, in the little-recognized American tradition of Natural Hygiene, the organism is understood to be the sole healer of itself, in no need need of such promptings. It merely requires the necessary conditions of healing. These are identical to the normal conditions of health (warmth, food, air, exercise, etc), sometimes with their proportions temporarily adjusted. The processes of self-healing, of self-repair, inhere in the fact of self-preservation.

Self-preservation is the essential characteristic of all organisms, from complex, conscious ones to single-celled ones. No biology text or course fails to mention this immediately. I remember having this discussion in a class in grade school. Even doctors often admit their dependence on the body's power to heal. Because Hygienists fully recognize it without exception or contradiction, we admit no substance, treatment, therapist, or practice as the cause of health, only the body itself. The body can only use ordinary conditions of life to both maintain and restore health: fresh air, pure water, work and rest, warm temperature, proper food, etc. All these are passive, inert, acted upon. The organism is the actor.

This also means there is no such person as a healer. Only the body has the power, materials, intelligence, and facilities to heal the body. Thus unobstructed by poisons, uninterrupted by treatment, untaxed by practices, and _unauthorized_ by therapists, Hygienic recovery is rapid, effortless, total, and permanent.

It is just that, in Natural Hygiene, this principle has never been fully applied to the recovery of the psyche itself. Even though, as Ayn Rand said, "Consciousness—for those living organisms which possess it—is the basic means of survival," consciousness has never been fully appreciated as both the seat of our woe and as an organic function capable of self-healing. Consequently, repose in darkness has, until now, remained unknown as the condition the psyche can best use to heal itself.

The explanation of impaired consciousness gets at why discipline is already so lacking in most of us, why the will flags and attention fizzles far short of any real attainment. It explains why we feel something is wrong with ourselves and try to fix it (discipline), get it fixed (management), or avoid it (sedation. See [strifeless](/strifeless/). But volitional functions _depend_ on unimpaired consciousness. They do not generate it. Any success is partial. The solution is to use the sliver of available will, not to strengthen the will in order to later break into latent energy reserves in the subtle bodies in order to effect transformation (the strategy of esoteric spiritual traditions), but to provide the being the conditions it requires to reenergize itself immediately and so restore its own psychic integrity. This puts the horse before the cart, automatically restoring the will to full function.

Rest is the primary condition of all healing. Darkness provides consciousness the opportunity to rest long and deeply enough to heal. It minimizes both the stimulation of and flow of energy to the "mind"—the habitual state of attention—which otherwise would continue to run all the time, night and day, waking and sleeping. The mind winds down.

Conveniently, darkness also gives the psyche a chance to restrengthen other modes of consciousness. One consciously receives and interacts with data streams different than those of the gross dimension. One enters the dreamworld spontaneously and consciously and awakens to great depths of creativity. Besides being intensely inspiring, this provides much needed entertainment while lying around for days in an artificial cave.

Dream energy from the dreamworld is necessary to create anything. Dream energy is creative energy. It is the fuel of positive imagination. In our society, access to the dreamworld is profoundly distorted. For the normal purposes of living, very little dream energy squeaks through our denial. Only a few can tap into enough of it to do anything in a remotely humane or vital way. The rest of us are left to fight over the scraps in this unconscious state of artificial scarcity and admire those who somehow got a golden ticket.

Thus anyone in civilization can do great things, but not everyone. There is not enough creative energy available on these savage terms. All that is left in view to the losers is the manipulation of gross matter. Its great inertia, reinforced by the state, discourages attempts to change its conventional forms. The masses develop a culture of resignation and discouragement and become the greatest anchors of the status quo. (Until things get excruciatingly bad, and the whole cycle starts over again. Which is why it is called a revolution. The blood of patriots feeding the tree of liberty and so forth. What a scam that turned out to be.)

When dreamtime is naturally reaccessed, the flow of creative energy surges back through the proper channels of ones own being to serve the life that is there. Not out into the ether where it is collected by spiritual vampires, celebrities, artists, rulers, the rich, and the lucky; or into productive work that the elite materially profit from. Permanent re-engagement with the dreamworld restores one's energetic reserves and balance to the point where you do not need a "market" or a state anymore. You will just need your body, your (extended) family, and the world as it is.

In repose, the spongy tissues of consciousness absorb this dreamy, creative, vital energy. Thus refueled, the healing of consciousness from its injuries accelerates and its impairment and psychosis fade. Sanity and health of the entire organism naturally result, and the exuberantly creative participation in life resumes as if nothing ever happened.

The catastrophic injury to the psyche I mention in the conjecture deserves some explanation.

Humanity is incredibly resilient and adaptable. So the first cause of this injury would have to be mythic in scale to wreck consciousness. It would have to be something that almost made us extinct. In effect, those who sustained this injury are like the survivors of an airplane crash, wandering bewildered, catatonic, completely disoriented. I believe it was some disastrous event in our distant past that shocked us so badly that we nearly lost touch with reality. Each generation simply passed the mass psychosis on to the next, brutalizing one child at a time. Our society passed it to others through the horrors of conquest. The process metamorphosed into our current, institutionalized catastrophe.

Maybe a comet hit Earth or planets changed position, causing a pole shift and massive geological changes. Not like the pissant tsunamis we have seen lately, but continent-drowning waves (like in the movie _2012_). Maybe the Flood. Maybe not a single event, but a series of events overwhelmed our people's capacity to cope. Maybe surviving grown-ups recovered but _children didn't_. I happen to imagine it as the shock of a mass transmigration of souls from the second dimension (see [myth of three peoples](/other-writings/myths) for the whole story).

In my search for joy, I have seen the same suffering all over. It didn't matter if my host was a multi-millionaire or a burger-flipper, the basic pain was the same.

Whatever the scenario, the basic idea is one of trauma: something from the outside causing damage so massive it overwhelmed the ability of everyone's psyche's to register it. It is thus blocked from memory. But it has not disappeared. We re-enact it without knowing or knowing why. I got this idea from [Immanuel Velikovsky](http://www.knowledge.co.uk/velikovsky/index.htm). He was a psychoanalyst who saw nuclear holocaust as the avoidable fulfilment of our unfathomable collective trauma.

A healthy organism always acts in its own best interest. Therefore, it could not be the source of its own inordinate, chronic suffering. Only an outside force could cause such suffering. Likewise, a healthy organism will never maliciously harm another organism. Since everyone was healthy at one point, this outside force could not have originated with others.

Therefore, it originated with nature, where massive shocks such as supernovas and meteorites are possible. Something like this happened, and we are still dealing with it.

A fundamental principle of Western psychology is that a sick person unconsciously repeats patterns learned in the past. If something is happening now, it is only because it happened before. This idea is not unique to the West, of course. Here is a Chinese proverb about it:

> If you want to know your past, look into your present conditions.  
> If you want to know your future, look into your present actions.

The catastrophe from our past keeps repeating itself in our daily lives. We experience it as:

* medical birth
* abuse and neglect (including the use of baby holders like cribs, playpens, and strollers)
* slow poisoning by manufactured food and television
* forced schooling
* tragic love
* demoralizing work
* war
* crime or injustice
* chronic illness
* natural disasters we are strangely unprepared for.

Generally, we attribute our troubles to error, evil, ignorance, or a flaw in human nature: ie, some version of the doctrine of original sin, which every civilized religion has. Their solution is always some kind of disciplined effort at which only a few can succeed [for now](/blog/2011/06/bodhisattva-math/).

Because of my experience of rapture, I do not think what we live with today is just how things or people are. I think it is the result of some kind of disaster. Who knows what, exactly. But it was big. It was impersonal&mdash;nobodys fault. And now we seem to have a chance to finally move on.

I do not mean just using darkness. We live in a benevolent universe. It is basically supportive of life. It is a set of conditions in which life exists and therefore can exist to its full potential. So a universe that, for whatever reason, caused the calamity that hurt us so badly 500 generations ago will also eventually provide for our recovery. People are innocent.

The conjecture includes something about accumulating vital energy. This is because only the organism can heal itself, and it needs energy to do it. Darkness is the best way I know of so far to accumulate this energy, because it provides for very deep rest. Fasting is another way, though my experience (including a long fast of 23 days) is that the organism tends to use the energy physically, not psychically. And there are other normal ways of accumulating energy. Sleeping. Relaxing on the lawn, etc.

I lived among Mayan Indians for 18 months. I tried using their calendar, which is really a schedule of various streams of cosmic energy that cycle on short and long timescales. Given their eery accuracy, I would not be surprised if their idea about 2012 is true. It is that Earth is entering a galactic energy stream, which is beginning to enable everyones organism to heal. We will gradually go back to ordinary safety, happiness, peace, and harmony. It is a very benevolent idea, anyway.

I believe this is our destiny. Darkness is simply a way to participate in what is happening anyway. It is way to run out and meet it.

A friend, Brian Sullivan, and I chatted about the darkness conjecture. Our conversation brought out the meaning and an important implication of the word _strifeless_ (from the subtitle).

> **Andrew:** We in civilization endure a terrible internal conflict. You know when you feel like you are going to explode? Or be torn apart? This conflict is caused by an unconscious denial of a subtle, but large part of reality called [dreamtime](/dreamtime). It is a dimension different than the usual, gross spacetime. Humans are normally aware of it but we are not. Civilization offers us three ways to deal with this conflict:
>
> 1. Sedation (through addiction)
> 2. Management (popular religion, psychotherapy, self-improvement, coaching, success seminars, spiritual materialism, weekend workshops, etc)
> 3. Discipline (genuine spiritual practice).
>
> While some have gone far with management and sometimes even sedation, only discipline reliably resolves this conflict. But it does so only for the 1% or less of the population than can handle the intensity of the discipline involved. A solution that works for less than 1% of people is, from the perspective of design, no solution at all.
>
> **Brian:** The rest just need dreamtime?
>
> **A:** Well, everyone needs dreamtime.
>
> **B:** Right.
>
> **A:** What the rest of us need is an easier way to cease denying our awareness of it. What these three ways have in common is the idea that strife is just how life is. Life sucks. Get used to it.
>
> But I am way too lazy and narcissistic to believe this. Always have been. Anyway, I have seen [otherwise](/rapture). Life is not inherently painful, just living like this. There is another way. Something is broken; lets fix it already!
>
> **B:** Very nice.
>
> **A:** I mean, I have fixed bicycles. I have seen scratches on my knee heal without effort. Things can actually work, you know?! So why can't consciousness work again?
>
> **B:** Yeah, I agree, life works.
>
> **A:** Why does something that only took a moment to break need a lifetime to learn to repair? Biologically, it makes no sense. Extended total darkness allows for rest that could be deep enough and long enough for consciousness to unhook itself from gross matter and heal itself automatically. This is the conjecture.

#### Afterword:

This process will not make a person enlightened or give him back all that he could have had in an untraumatized life. It is a very limited thing that darkness might enable the organism to accomplish. Plenty of wreckage would remain, inside and out, to clean up and repair over generations. This is just a possible way to deal with the knotted core of the illness, yet without the strife that characterizes and perpetuates it. The means is the end. Strife cannot produce ease at ones core.

Moreover, even if the conjecture fails, in its strifelessness, it indicates an entirely new _kind_ of solution to the problem of how bad we feel and how rotten things are for everyone in this lifeway. Again, the standard solutions accept conflict as an essential quality of life and then require strife to overcome it. A strifeless solution, a&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;_pleasant and easy_ solution*, relies completely on the unfailingly benevolent forces of life and the universe, rather than will, to undo what was done. Swiftly, quietly, and permanently, in one shot, like a broken bone properly set and braced.

Darkness is but one such force. It is a normal condition of life. In the retreat, one temporarily extends darkness while convalescing from the long infirmity. It is just as one tends, when ill, to eat less, stay in bed longer and drink more water. I know no more promising a condition for the recovery of rapture and the dissolution of inordinate suffering than darkness. But if it proves insufficient or fails, then we, the [research family](/blog/2009/02/its-not-mine-alone/) I just wrote about, would set about amending or replacing it. I wouldn't mind so much if darkness in particular works or not. But I believe it or something strifeless like it will, and that together we could have an excellent time working that out. (More about this later in the "project" essay.)

&nbsp;

*by this I mean _predominantly_ easy and pleasant. There can be difficult, painful moments in darkness, some of which require focused attention to overcome. But these are exceptions, not the rule. The principal actor in the situation, like ones champion in a duel, remains the autonomic organism. This feeling of a great force come to ones aid in a crisis is indescribably encouraging.

Here I would like to relate the history and future of this project.

Since 2006, I have attempted seven retreats, two successful, two semi- successful, three failures \[plus seven more retreats since writing this essay\]. These results depended entirely on how well the room worked mechanically (not, thank god, my morale or effort during the retreat). I do not think it necessarily tricky to achieve the conditions of a retreat, but it has been for me.

In late 2008, the point of dark retreating became really clear to me and I began focusing on it full-time. My goal has been to do a long (14-day) retreat. Following my first failure at this in March, 2009, I drafted most of the content of this booklet and posted it online.

In Guatemala, between late-2009 and mid-2011, I built and ran a dark retreat in the garage of my house. Nineteen people, including myself, retreated there. Seventeen of us had positive experiences, one neutral, one negative. At some point I will publish comments by retreatants about their retreats. According to them, people generally came out feeling more rested, more in their bodies, more _themselves_. Those who understood the conjecture beforehand said that they still found it plausible.

All of this was instructive and encouraging. But failure has also given me pause. Here is what I wrote about it in my retreat notes, scribbled in darkness in a moment of heartbroken clarity: "Can't do things by the seat of my pants anymore. Too stressful. Too much missed in the meantime. Need proper planning, more participation, more money, better site.

I believe my failure has largely resulted from my exaggerated fear of interacting with other people. In true Catch-22 fashion, this fear has arisen from that which I have been trying to recover from. The cycle has to end somewhere, so the next phase of the project involves republishing a booklet of these writings, discussing the project with close supporters, and giving free public talks. The purpose of all this is to gauge interest, gather support, and invite wider participation. Rather than just invite people to help me do my thing as I have done in the past, I would like to open up the project to others equal participation.

The first thing I am doing in this regard is releasing the content of this booklet so that anyone may [freely](http://copyheart.org/) copy, distribute, and sell (yes, _sell_) this content in any media. Suggest changes by submitting [pull requests](https://github.com/yodrew/hod). Include this license in your reprints, and I will similarly recognize and link to you on andrewdurham.com. Share 8% of your street price with me or somehow astound me and I will also give you my [endorsement](http://questioncopyright.org/creator_endorsed), a visible mark to use on products and ads. This deal roughly equals what you and I would make if I were published or self-published, without your having to order in bulk. PayPal, Dwolla, and write me at info {at} andrewdurham.com.


Next, I will make a visit to my close supporters in Scandinavia where we can seriously talk about this project. Thank god for friends. My personal goal remains the completion of a 14-day dark retreat. This promises to entail more than I am used to handling.

Which may be why I have so many other ideas for the application of the principle, it makes my head spin. Especially since my last [retreat](/blog/2011/03/14-day-darkness-retreat-cut-short/). The strifeless principle says that a fundamental state of integrity, ease, and joy are natural to human beings, and are restored by a basically easy, graceful approach. This contrasts with the pervasive idea that conflict, struggle and suffering are natural to us and can only be overcome by a great and painful effort.

For me, strifelessness is like a software platform. It is an open source design perspective which anybody can use to solve any problem arising from our mass functional psychosis. The strifeless platform is a serious yet relaxed way of approaching, shall we say, exceedingly conflicted situations. The platform itself can emerge within or take many forms: social movement, business, extended family, non-profit clearinghouse, R&amp;D lab, thinktank. Thus any group---existing, new, or ad hoc---can use it to focus on a given situation in an appropriate way.

For example, the Hygienic use of darkness is a strifeless way of approaching the hairy monster of near constant suffering. Since nearly everyone knows this monster intimately, a time may come when every bedroom becomes a darkroom, and dark retreats outnumber restaurants. I would like there to be so much demand for retreats, it could, for instance, pay for the restoration of the hundreds of Mayan pyramids (once used as darkness chambers) still buried in the jungle, as well as the shamans to run them. I would like retreats to take every possible form, from commercial luxury to gutterpunk austerity. It could all spread as easily as bottled water or cellphones but without the attendant waste.

Certain groups and events also seem to have come together naturally:

* The Free Software movement.
* The Rainbow Family and its Gatherings
* CrimethInc, a viral, leaderless, anarchist movement, diffused in anonymous cells around the world, and yet consistent in its message, style, and functioning
* Kickstarter Project-Funding Platform

The strifeless platform would also happen naturally like these. Not to say there is no effort involved, just that the project provides an abundance of the necessary energy. There would be maximum freedom of participation for everyone, from sitting in the corner ignoring everyone to being in a center of action. All the ordinary ways of getting along with people would still apply. Actions, expressions, and ideas belong to those who have them, not the group or any authority. What I know about strifelessness will probably come in handy, but I am not in charge. If I knew exactly how to do this on my own, it would already be done.

The history of design also provides a ton of examples I would call strifeless:

* Dvorak typing keyboard
* Self-Strutting Geodesic Plydome
* seedballs
* Esperanto
* barefoot sandal
* the bicycle, possibly the greatest design of all time

My ideas entail working in some kind of group that, in the most direct and practical way, develops and applies the darkness conjecture, as well as provides information, designs, and support for the radical lifestyle changes necessary to halt forever the juggernaut of catastrophic psychic injury. These include:

* the strifeless platform itself
* a dark retreat and research center built from scratch with work areas and with six darkrooms (several people have asked for this)
* a franchise system for existing retreat centers to add dark retreats to their offerings (a close supporter, Roman, had this one)
* a neighborhood development that radically recognizes the basic human need for freedom (David, a friend with Project Nuevo Mundo, helped inspire this)
* for daily sleeping: 
    * a system for elegantly darkening ones shelter at night (current systems are toxic, expensive, and actually leak light)
    * a new lightweight, multi-purpose bed that can transform your lifestyle and livelihood
    * a new kind of pillow based on a simple observation of sleeping positions
    * a sleeping mask that blocks all light and comfortably stays on all night
* a typable, e-paper tablet computer with which to do basic work without injury or distraction (alpha software now available!)
* a series of documents, electronic and printed, that use clear information design to succinctly explain the essential content and structure of modern tools (like computers or a new foreign language) as well as timeless necessities (like diet and parenting)
* Superhomeless mobile shelter/furnishing kits for living in style as a permanent camper (idea from Laservida Arts Collective, Las Vegas, NV)
* $500 portable shelter kits and the hydraulic transmission-equipped bicycles and carts to move them.
* color-balanced LED lamps and flashlights
* web-based credit clearing system (Thomas Grecos idea)
* gravity powered motor (old design, new materials)

other needful designs---including those of others---consonant with the strifeless approach to be developed, crowdfunded, and offered until everyone functions so well we no longer need them

Saying all this at this point is an experiment. I hope you find it interesting and inspiring rather than discouraging. Please tell me how you like it. I am just trying different ways of reaching out. Text files are easy to change; discouragement is not.

Basically, I believe there are plenty of people who are in the same boat as I, having declined/rejected/imploded the roles we were offered in this cancerous lifeway. Like me, they look for a viable alternative. They would be glad to participate in it if they thought it might work. Like me, they feel they have nothing to lose. Maybe they find the logic of the conjecture strangely compelling as I do.

That said, the darkness conjecture is just a sketch of a hypothesis. It needs fleshing out and further testing. I make no promises, only a reasonable case for it. I am not bringing a revelation from the mountain, just a sketch of it from the plain. I would like to go there one day. Maybe you're headed that way, too.

Sometimes I think of the group as a family, a research family. We would be a band of refugees from the death-culture, explorers of the future, looking together for a bridge to a human way of life. Each of us has different aptitudes and sensibilities, all of which are necessary to arrive at a genuine solution to the problem we all face: suffering in place of rapture.

Thus I offer these writings to attract interest, support, and participation in a strifeless approach to recovering rapture and the development of a sane lifestyle for those in recovery from suffering. This involves testing dark retreating as a simple, cheap, quick, pleasant, and replicable way of permanently healing from psychic trauma and restoring the basic functions of human consciousness, including waking awareness of the dreamworld. If effective, this would rapidly lead to solutions to every excruciating problem suffered by humanity since the rise of civilization, as well as the reemergence of a humane and regenerative lifeway.
