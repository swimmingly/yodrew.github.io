I do everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating: study, experiment, write, speak, consult, design, build. 

#### writing

- Get my ebook from [leanpub](http://leanpub.com/darkroomretreat)
- Quote and excerpt anything in my book and website. Credit me and tell me where it will show up and I will also acknowledge and link to you on my website.
- Invite me to write for your publication on any subject related to hygienic darkroom retreating and hygienic psychology.  
- Publish me, make money. See [*license*](/license)

(Free or as you please)

#### speaking

Invite me to edify your audience.

(My minimalist expenses + something that fits your budget.)

#### consulting

Get my advice on darkroom retreating, building darkrooms, and issues arising thereof.

(&euro;15/hr. First couple emails are free if you have read my book.)

I will respond in detail, by email or skype, to all your questions and concerns about:

- how, where, and why to set up a darkroom
- how to organize a retreat with or without a supporter
- how to deal with specific issues you have about retreating itself

My responses will be based on my experience. Over the past ten years, I have:

- done 20 retreats from 2-6 days long
- facilitated 25 retreats for others
- designed and built 15 working darkrooms, operating three of them
- written 100,000 words about darkroom retreating for web, email, and print
- given 14 public talks

#### design-build

Have me design and build your darkroom in an existing building or from scratch.

(&euro;15/hr + materials, travel, & shelter)
